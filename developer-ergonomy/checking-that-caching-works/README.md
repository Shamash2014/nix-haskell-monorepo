# Checking That Caching Works

All the instantiation related commands (read building commands) support the `--dry-run` flag even though it's not documented.

```bash
nix-build --dry-run monorepo.nix
```

Such invocations will output two lists - first the list of derivations that will be fetched from caches and second the list of
all derivations that will be built from source.

```
TODO add example output
```

## Nix cache debugging

You can test that the cache is reachable by querying the `/nix-cache-info` endpoint. This should return something along the lines of:

```
StoreDir: /nix/store
WantMassQuery: 1
Priority: 30
```

The info about a derivation is exposed at "/<hash of the derivation>.narinfo".
So if you're trying to build `/nix/store/d4vqy3sh0ngm9hsp7wwils7j6bms52xc-foundation-0.0.23` and your cache is at `http://10.0.0.3:5000` Nix will first
query `http://10.0.0.3:5000/d4vqy3sh0ngm9hsp7wwils7j6bms52xc.narinfo`. Assuming the cache contains the package the output will look something like:

```
StorePath: /nix/store/d4vqy3sh0ngm9hsp7wwils7j6bms52xc-foundation-0.0.23
URL: nar/d4vqy3sh0ngm9hsp7wwils7j6bms52xc.nar
Compression: none
NarHash: sha256:1nbv1cci1vrh1h2wxxbd0wdmh9jr47kkhz8207jjg9b9fw60vwsv

```

If the cache doesn't have the desired derivation it will simply return a 404.


In the [next chapter](../prefetch-nixpkgs.sh) we will write a script to mitigate first-time executions of Nix.
